# BoxCharacterController
An attempt to make a character controller like in the Source Engine

Supports "Bunny Hop"

The idea was not to use the capsule CharacterController, cos unstable movements and wall edge sliding, hard to calculate ground normals and ground state.
BoxCharacterController can be used separately from physics.
